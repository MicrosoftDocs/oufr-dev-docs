## Overview
ScrollablePane is a helper component designed to use in conjunction with a Sticky component. Sticky components will &quot;stick&quot; to the top or bottom of a ScrollablePane&#39;s scrollable region and remain visible. ScrollablePane requires a height or max-height set either on the component itself, or on the immediate parent element.



## Do &#10003;
- ScrollablePane uses &#x60;position: absolute&#x60;. Ensure that the parent element has an explicit &#x60;height&#x60; and &#x60;position: relative&#x60;, or has space already allocated for ScrollablePane (e.g: flexbox).
- Use Sticky component on block level elements
- Sticky component are ideally section headers and&#x2F;or footers
- Ensure that the total height of Sticky components do not exceed the height of the ScrollablePane


## Don't &#10008;
- Don&#39;t use Sticky on elements with &#x60;margin-top&#x60; or &#x60;margin-bottom&#x60;
