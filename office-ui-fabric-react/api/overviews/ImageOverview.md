# Overview
An image is a graphic representation of something (e.g photo or illustration). The borders have been added to these examples in order to help visualize empty space in the image frame.



## Do &#10003;
- Provide descriptive values for the alt text attribute for all images.
If alt text isn&#39;t provided for images, the image information is inaccessible, for example, to people who cannot see and use a screen reader that reads aloud the information on a page.
  - Consider context. If the image represents a function, be sure to indicate that. If it is to be consumed with other objects on the page, consider that as well.
  - Make the description brief but accurate. Use one sentence, two at the most.


## Don't &#10008;
- Repeat information in your alt text that is already on the page. Don&#39;t use &quot;image of&quot; or &quot;graphic of&quot; to describe it, as that is already apparent to the reader.
