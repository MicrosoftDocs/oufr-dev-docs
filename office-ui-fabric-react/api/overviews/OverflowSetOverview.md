## Overview
The OverflowSet is a flexible container component that is useful for displaying a primary set of content with additional content in an overflow callout. Note that the example below is only an example of how to render the component, not a specific use case.

### Accessibility

By default, the OverflowSet is simply &#x60;role&#x3D;group&#x60;. If you used as a menu, you will need to add &#x60;role&#x3D;&quot;menubar&quot;&#x60; and add proper aria roles to each rendered item (&#x60;menuitem&#x60;, &#x60;menuitemcheckbox&#x60;, &#x60;menuitemradio&#x60;)
