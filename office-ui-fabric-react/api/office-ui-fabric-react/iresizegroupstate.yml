    summary: >-
      Are we resizing to accommodate having more or less available space? The
      'grow' direction is when the container may have more room than the last
      render, such as when a window resize occurs. This means we will try to fit
      more content in the window. The 'shrink' direction is when the contents
      don't fit in the container and we need to find a transformation of the
      data that makes everything fit.
