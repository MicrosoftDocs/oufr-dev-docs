      The image is not scaled. The image is centered and cropped within the
      content box.

    package: '@fluentui/react!'
    summary: >-
      The image will be centered horizontally and vertically within the frame
      and maintains its aspect ratio. It will behave as ImageFit.center if the
      image's natural height and width is less than the Image frame's height and
      width, but if either natural height or width are larger than the frame it
      will behave as ImageFit.contain.

  - name: centerCover

    package: '@fluentui/react!'
    summary: >-
      The image will be centered horizontally and vertically within the frame
      and maintains its aspect ratio. It will behave as ImageFit.center if the
      image's natural height or width is less than the Image frame's height or
      width, but if both natural height and width are larger than the frame it
      will behave as ImageFit.cover.
    value: '4'
  - name: contain
    uid: '@fluentui/react!ImageFit.contain:member'
    package: '@fluentui/react!'
    summary: >-
      The image is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while being fully
      contained within the frame. The image will be centered horizontally and
      vertically within the frame. The space in the top and bottom or in the
      sides of the frame will be empty depending on the difference in aspect
      ratio between the image and the frame.
    value: '1'
  - name: cover
    uid: '@fluentui/react!ImageFit.cover:member'
    package: '@fluentui/react!'
    summary: >-
      The image is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the frame.
      Portions of the image will be cropped from the top and bottom, or the
      sides, depending on the difference in aspect ratio between the image and
      the frame.
    value: '2'
  - name: none
    uid: '@fluentui/react!ImageFit.none:member'
    package: '@fluentui/react!'
    summary: >-
      Neither the image nor the frame are scaled. If their sizes do not match,
      the image will either be cropped or the frame will have empty space.
