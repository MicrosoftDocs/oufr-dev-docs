## Overview
A Checkbox is a UI element that allows users to switch between two mutually exclusive options (checked or unchecked, on or off) through a single click or tap. It can also be used to indicate a subordinate setting or preference when paired with another control.

A Checkbox is used to select or deselect action items. It can be used for a single item or for a list of multiple items that a user can choose from. The control has two selection states: unselected and selected.

Use a single Checkbox for a subordinate setting, such as with a &quot;Remember me?&quot; login scenario or with a terms of service agreement.

For a binary choice, the main difference between a Checkbox and a toggle switch is that the Checkbox is for status and the toggle switch is for action. You can delay committing a Checkbox interaction (as part of a form submit, for example), while you should immediately commit a toggle switch interaction. Also, only Checkboxes allow for multi-selection.

Use multiple Checkboxes for multi-select scenarios in which a user chooses one or more items from a group of choices that are not mutually exclusive.



## Do &#10003;
- Allow users to choose any combination of options when several Checkboxes are grouped together.


## Don't &#10008;
- Don&#39;t use a Checkbox as an on&#x2F;off control. Instead use a toggle switch.
- Donâ€™t use a Checkbox when the user can choose only one option from the group, use radio buttons instead.
- Don&#39;t put two groups of Checkboxes next to each other. Separate the two groups with labels.
