## Overview
Ratings provide insight regarding others’ opinions and experiences with a product, helping users make more-informed purchasing decisions. Users can also rate products they’ve purchased.



## Do &#10003;
- Make it clear which product the rating pertains to by making sure the layout and grouping are clear when several products are on the page.


## Don't &#10008;
- Don’t use the rating component for data that has a continuous range, such as the brightness of a photo. Instead, use a slider.
