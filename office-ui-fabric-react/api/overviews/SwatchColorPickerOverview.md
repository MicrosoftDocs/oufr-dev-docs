## Overview
A SwatchColorPicker is a list of colors displayed as a grid as options for the user. It can be displayed by itself, with header and&#x2F;or dividers, or as a button which expands to show the swatch color picker.



## Do &#10003;
- Use a SwatchColorPicker when there are multiple finite choices that can be grouped and&#x2F;or collapsed under one title.
- SwatchColorPickers contain a grid of colors.


## Don't &#10008;
- Do not use a SwatchColorPicker when there are a a very large number of color choices. The best component for to that is a ColorPicker.
