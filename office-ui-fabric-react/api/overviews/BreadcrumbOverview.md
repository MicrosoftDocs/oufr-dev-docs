## Overview
Breadcrumbs should be used as a navigational aid in your app or site. They indicate the current pageâ€™s location within a hierarchy and help the user understand where they are in relation to the rest of that hierarchy. They also afford one-click access to higher levels of that hierarchy.

Breadcrumbs are typically placed, in horizontal form, under the masthead or navigation of an experience, above the primary content area.



## Do &#10003;
- Place Breadcrumbs at the top of a page, above a list of items, or above the main content of a page.


## Don't &#10008;
- Don&#39;t use Breadcrumbs as a primary way to navigate an app or site.
