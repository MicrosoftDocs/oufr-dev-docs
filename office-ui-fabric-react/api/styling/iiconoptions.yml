      By default, registering the same set of icons will generate a console warning per duplicate icon registered,
      because this scenario can create unexpected consequences.


      Some scenarios include:


      Icon set was previously registered using a different base url. Icon set was previously registered but a different
      version was provided. Icons in a previous registered set overlap with a new set.


      To simply ignore previously registered icons, you can specify to disable warnings. This means that if an icon
      which was previous registered is registered again, it will be silently ignored. However, consider whether the
      problems listed above will cause issues.
