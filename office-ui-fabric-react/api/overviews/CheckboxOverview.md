## Overview
Check boxes (&#x60;Checkbox&#x60;) give people a way to select one or more items from a group, or switch between two mutually exclusive options (checked or unchecked, on or off). 



## Do &#10003;
- Allow users to choose any combination of options when several Checkboxes are grouped together.


## Don't &#10008;
- Don&#39;t use a Checkbox as an on&#x2F;off control. Instead use a toggle switch.
- Don’t use a Checkbox when the user can choose only one option from the group, use radio buttons instead.
- Don&#39;t put two groups of Checkboxes next to each other. Separate the two groups with labels.
