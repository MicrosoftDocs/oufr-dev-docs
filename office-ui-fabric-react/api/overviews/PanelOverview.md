## Overview
Panels are overlays that contain supplementary content and are used for complex creation, edit, or management experiences.  For example, viewing details about an item in a list or editing settings.



## Do &#10003;
- Use for self-contained experiences where the user does not need to interact with the app view to complete the task.
- Use for complex creation, edit or management experiences.
- Consider how the panel and its contained contents will scale across Fluent UI React’s responsive web breakpoints.
- Make sure to have a minimum width of 340px for the &#x60;Panel&#x60; component


## Don't &#10008;
- Use for experiences where the user needs to interact with the app view.
