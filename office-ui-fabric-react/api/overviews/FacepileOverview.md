## Overview
A face pile (&#x60;Facepile&#x60;) displays a list of personas. Each circle represents a person and contains their image or initials. Often this control is used when sharing who has access to a specific view or file, or when assigning someone a task within a workflow.



## Do &#10003;
- Use if looking for a way to represent who has access to an area and need to show that as a people representation.
- Only show the Add button if a user has access to do so.
- Allow a way for the user to understand who the person is. Many common ways to do this are with a tooltip or adding the ability to open up a PeopleCard Experience.


## Don't &#10008;
- Use for things other than people.
- Overwhelm users by listing every single person as a circle but truncate and provide a way to see the full list.
- Don’t use this control for experiences where you need to manage details of hundreds of users, you are better off using a list control.
