      Are we resizing to accommodate having more or less available space? The 'grow' direction is when the container may
      have more room than the last render, such as when a window resize occurs. This means we will try to fit more
      content in the window. The 'shrink' direction is when the contents don't fit in the container and we need to find
      a transformation of the data that makes everything fit.
