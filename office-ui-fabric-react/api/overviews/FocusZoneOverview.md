## Overview
FocusZones abstract arrow key navigation behaviors. Tabbable elements (buttons, anchors, and elements with data-is-focusable&#x3D;&#39;true&#39; attributes) are considered when pressing directional arrow keys and focus is moved appropriately. Tabbing to a zone sets focus only to the current &quot;active&quot; element, making it simple to use the tab key to transition from one zone to the next, rather than through every focusable element.

Using a FocusZone is simple. Just wrap a bunch of content inside of a FocusZone, and arrows and tabbling will be handled for you! See examples below.
