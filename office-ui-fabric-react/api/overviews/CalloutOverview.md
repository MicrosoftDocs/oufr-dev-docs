## Overview
A callout is an anchored tip that can be used to teach people or guide them through the app without blocking them.



## Do &#10003;
- Use Callouts to introduce new concepts in an experience where highlighting specific pieces of the UI is necessary.
- Do be concise with the information you provide inside of a Callout. Short sentences or sentence fragments are best.
- Do be helpful with the tip text inside of your Callout.
- Do limit the information inside of a Callout to supplemental information that users don&#39;t have to read.
- Callouts should be placed near the object being described, usually at the pointer&#39;s tail or head if possible.
- When additional context - or more advanced description - is necessary, consider placing a link to &quot;Learn more&quot; at the bottom of the Callout and opening the additional content in a new window or Panel when clicked.


## Don't &#10008;
- Don’t overuse Callout without putting the user in control. Too many Callouts which open automatically can be perceived as interrupting workflow and are a bad user experience.
- Don&#39;t use large, unformatted blocks of text in your Callout, they are difficult to read and overwhelming.
- Don&#39;t put obvious tip text, or text that simply repeats what is already on the screen in your Callout.
- Because the content inside of a Callout isn&#39;t always visible, don&#39;t put important or required information in a Callout.
- Don’t block important UI with the placement of your Callout, it is a poor user experience that will lead to frustration.
- Don’t open Callout from within another Callout.
- Don’t use Callout to ask the user to confirm an action, use a Dialog instead.
- Don’t show Callouts on hidden elements.
