      By default, registering the same set of icons will generate a console
      warning per duplicate icon registered, because this scenario can create
      unexpected consequences.


      Some scenarios include:


      Icon set was previously registered using a different base url. Icon set
      was previously registered but a different version was provided. Icons in a
      previous registered set overlap with a new set.


      To simply ignore previously registered icons, you can specify to disable
      warnings. This means that if an icon which was previous registered is
      registered again, it will be silently ignored. However, consider whether
      the problems listed above will cause issues.
