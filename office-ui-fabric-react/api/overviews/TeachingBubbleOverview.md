## Overview
A teaching bubble (&#x60;TeachingBubble&#x60;) brings attention to a new or important feature, with the goal of increasing engagement with the feature. A teaching bubble typically follows a coach mark.

- Use TeachingBubbles for a limited time, usually while a feature is considered &quot;new&quot;.
