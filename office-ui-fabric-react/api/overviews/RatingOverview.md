## Overview
Ratings show people’s opinions of a product, helping others make more informed purchasing decisions. People can also rate products they’ve purchased.



## Do &#10003;
- Make it clear which product the rating pertains to by making sure the layout and grouping are clear when several products are on the page.


## Don't &#10008;
- Don’t use the rating component for data that has a continuous range, such as the brightness of a photo. Instead, use a slider.
