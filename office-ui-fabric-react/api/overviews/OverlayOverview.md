# Overview
Overlays are used to render a semi-transparent layer on top of existing UI. Overlays help focus the user on the content that sits above the added layer and are often used to help designate a modal or blocking experience. Overlays can be seen used in conjunction with Panels and Dialogs.


## Do &#10003;
- Use a dark Overlay with a first-run experience.
- Use a white Overlay for dialogs and panels.

## Don't &#10008;
- Use an Overlay when you want the user to interact with the UI that is being covered.
