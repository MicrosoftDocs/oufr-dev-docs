## Overview
The people picker (&#x60;PeoplePicker&#x60;) is used to select one or more entities, such as people or groups, from a list. It makes composing an email to someone, or adding them to a group, easy if you don’t know their full name or email address.



## Do &#10003;
- Use the PeoplePicker to quickly search for a few people
- Use the PeoplePicker to manage a group of people
- Use the MemberList PeoplePicker to display selections below the input box
- Use defaultSelectedItems when some people have already been selected


## Don't &#10008;
- Use the PeoplePicker to select something other than people
- Use the PeoplePicker to only display people
- Use the PeoplePicker without sufficient space
