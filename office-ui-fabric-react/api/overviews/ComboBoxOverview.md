## Overview
A combo box (&#x60;ComboBox&#x60;) combines a text field and a dropdown giving people a way to select an option from a list or enter their own choice.



## Do &#10003;
- Use a ComboBox when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed under one title. Or if the list of items is long or when space is constrained.
- ComboBoxs contain shortened statements or words.
- Use a ComboBox when the selected option is more important than the alternatives (in contrast to radio buttons where all the choices are visible putting more emphasis on the other options).


## Don't &#10008;
&lt;!-- Insert Donts Here --&gt;
