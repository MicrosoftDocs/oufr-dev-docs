## Overview
A slider provides a visual indication of adjustable content, as well as the current setting in the total range of content. Use a slider when you want people to set defined values (such as volume or brightness), or when people would benefit from instant feedback on the effect of setting changes.



## Do &#10003;
- Consider a Slider when changing a value.
- Use a slider when you want your users to be able to set defined values (such as volume or brightness).
- Include a label indicating what value the Slider changes.
- Use step points (or tick marks) if you don’t want the Slider to allow arbitrary values between min and max.
- Use a Slider when the user would benefit from instant feedback on the effect of setting changes.


## Don't &#10008;
- Don&#39;t use a Slider when the options are not values.
- Don’t use a Slider for binary settings.
- Don’t create a continuous Slider if the range of values is large.
- Don’t use for a range of three values or less.
