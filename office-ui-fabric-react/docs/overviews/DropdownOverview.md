# Overview
A Dropdown is a list in which the selected item is always visible, and the others are visible on demand by clicking a drop-down button. They are used to simplify the design and make a choice within the UI. When closed, only the selected item is visible. When users click the drop-down button, all the options become visible. To change the value, users open the list and click another value or use the arrow keys (up and down) to select a new value.


# Best Practices

## Do &#10003;
- Use a Dropdown when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed under one title. Or if the list of items is long or when space is constrained.
- Use shortened statements or single words as options.
- Use a Dropdown when the selected option is more important than the alternatives (in contrast to radio buttons where all the choices are visible putting more emphasis on the other options).
