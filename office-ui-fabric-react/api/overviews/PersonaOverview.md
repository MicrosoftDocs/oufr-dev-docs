## Overview
A persona is a visual representation of a person across products, typically showcasing the image that person has chosen to upload themselves. The control can also be used to show that person&#39;s online status.

The complete control inclues an individual&#39;s avatar (an uploaded image or a composition of the person’s initials on a background color), their name or identification, and online status.

The persona control is used in the &#x60;PeoplePicker&#x60; and &#x60;Facepile&#x60; controls.



## Do &#10003;
- Use Size 24 Persona in text fields in read mode or in experiences such as multi-column list view which need compact Persona representations.
- Use Size 32 Persona in text fields in edit mode.
- Use Size 32, Size 40, and Size 48 Personas in menus and list views.
- Use Size 72 and Size 100 Personas in profile cards and views.


## Don't &#10008;
- Change the values of the color swatches in high contrast mode.
