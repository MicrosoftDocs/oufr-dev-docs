## Overview
A dropdownÂ is a list in which the selected item is always visible while other items are visible on demand by clicking a dropdown button. Dropdowns are typically used for forms. 



## Do &#10003;
- Use a Dropdown when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed under one title. Or if the list of items is long or when space is constrained.
- Use shortened statements or single words as options.
- Use a Dropdown when the selected option is more important than the alternatives (in contrast to radio buttons where all the choices are visible putting more emphasis on the other options).
