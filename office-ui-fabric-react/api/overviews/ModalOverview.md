## Overview
Modals are temporary pop-ups that take focus from the page or app and require people to interact with them. Unlike a dialog box (&#x60;Dialog&#x60;), a modal should be used for hosting lengthy content, such as privacy statements or license agreements, or for asking people to perform complex or multiple actions, such as changing settings.



## Do &#10003;
- Use Modals for actionable interactions, such as needing the user to provide information or change settings.
- When possible, try a non-blocking Modal before resorting to a blocking Modal.
- Always have at least one focusable element inside a Modal.


## Don't &#10008;
- Don’t overuse Modals. In some cases they can be perceived as interrupting workflow, and too many can be a bad user experience.
