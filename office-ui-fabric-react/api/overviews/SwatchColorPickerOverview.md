## Overview
A swatch color picker (&#x60;SwatchColorPicker&#x60;) displays color options as a grid. It can be shown by itself, with a header and dividers, or as a button that expands to show the swatch color picker.



## Do &#10003;
- Use a SwatchColorPicker when there are multiple finite choices that can be grouped and&#x2F;or collapsed under one title.
- SwatchColorPickers contain a grid of colors.


## Don't &#10008;
- Do not use a SwatchColorPicker when there are a a very large number of color choices. The best component for to that is a ColorPicker.
